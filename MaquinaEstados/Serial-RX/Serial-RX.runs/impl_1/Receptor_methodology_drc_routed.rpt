Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DatoOut[5] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DatoOut[6] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DatoOut[7] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u1/code_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u1/code_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
