INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u11/u1/FSM_sequential_estadoActual_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u11/u1/cuenta[4]_i_2/O, cell u11/u1/cuenta[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT u11/u1/cuenta[4]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 5 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
u3/cuenta_reg[0], u3/cuenta_reg[1], u3/cuenta_reg[2], u3/cuenta_reg[3], and u3/cuenta_reg[4]
INFO: [Vivado 12-3199] DRC finished with 0 Errors, 2 Warnings
